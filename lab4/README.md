# Lab 4 - Versioning, Cross Region Replication, and Events

## Introduction
This lab will take you through the process of enabling object versioning, configuring CRR (Cross Region Replication), and facilitating event driven notifications.

## Versioning Overview
Versioning is a data protection mechanism for S3 buckets/objects. Versioning is enabled at the bucket level and is highly recommended as AWS considers it a "best practice". It can be enabled via the console or programatically. This session focuses on the console.

Highlights: Protects against unintended deletes (Recycle Bin), No performance penalty, Easy retrieval of deleted objects.
Integrates well with Lifecycle policies to help clean up older versions and move data to different storage classes.

## Lab Overview
This lab will show how to copy objects from one AWS account to another.
You will start out by viewing the objects in the source bucket and setting up a bucket policy.
